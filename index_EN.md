# 1-on-1 Kit
[English Version](index_EN.md) | [GitHub](https://github.com/stakiran/1on1-kit/settings/pages)

## Introduction
### You can create 1-on-1s
What comes to mind when you hear "1-on-1"?

You probably picture something mandated top-down. For example: "A manager and a direct report have a conversation once a month about the employee's career or work."

But 1-on-1s aren't limited to that. There are many possible ways to do them. You can even create your own. **Let's create the 1-on-1s you need.**

### About this kit
This kit provides a trigger list (a collection of perspectives) for creating 1-on-1s.

Note: This is a reference implementation by the author, so please customize it to suit your needs. The reference implementation is flexible enough to support even a "text-only 1-on-1," which is why it includes many items.

## 1-on-1 Kit

```markdown
## Basics
- Frequency?
    - Recurring? Weekly, monthly, biweekly, etc.
    - Ad hoc?
- Duration?
    - How long? 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, etc.
    - Is it okay to end before the halfway point, or should you try to stick it out?
- Participants?
    - Who and who?
    - Limit to the same reporting line, or not?
    - Change roles? Keep them the same? Leave unspecified?
- Symmetry?
    - Who talks how much? 1:9? 3:7? 5:5?

## Facilitation
- Is the topic specified?
- Is there facilitation? If so, who does it?

## Setup
- Format? In-person meeting? Remote meeting? Virtual office? Chat or notes only?
- How do you request it? And which side makes the request?
    - Who initiates the request? Or automate it and have software suggest it?

## Support
- Recording? If yes, can it be automatic, or does it require an explicit start? Who starts it?
- Materials? If yes, who shares them and how? Also, will you present/screen-share them?
- Is it okay to take notes during the 1-on-1?
    - Level? 1: prohibit or discourage, 2: allowed but don't wait, 3: wait as needed, 4: write more than you talk
